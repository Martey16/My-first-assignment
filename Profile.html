        <h2> THE JOURNEY</h2>
        <p class="first" id="first">
          My journey has not been the smoothest but I believe in the adage,
          “When the going gets tough, the tougher gets going” so I always held
          my head up. The desire to be a software engineer has been there in me
          right from childhood, the tricks I did with phones without been
          tutored anywhere about it, I always loved computer and cars. I
          finished secondary school at an early age of 16 but due to financial
          issues and my Dad was retiring soon and he knew I got the skills, he
          convinced me to enroll at a vocational school in Onitsha where I wrote
          the exams and made the first list after 3 years of studies I graduated
          in December, 2021 with an MTI Diploma certificate in Mechanical
          Maintenance Engineering.
        </p>
        <p class="second" id="second">
          On February 2022, I got a job at Asaba Delta state where I worked as a
          Mechanical technician before getting to a year I was already working
          as a mechanical technician and utility personnel in charge of the
          plant facilities but yet getting under paid because I am not yet a
          university graduate, as I get on the work I get on with the work I
          knew this is not what I want for this my life, as I scroll on Twitter
          I learnt that I can actually learn the skill I want to learn online
          without presently being there. I started making plans on how purchase
          a laptop out of my petty salary, I started saving monthly immediately
          after salary is paid thereby cutting my feeding expenses and other
          things I focused on what I want to achieve. Hopefully after a year of
          toil I finally bought laptop on February 2023. On May, I stumbled on a
          post on twitter where I saw about Altschool and I did not hesitate to
          make my enquiries and then apply to Hack Sultan's scholarship link, as
          the promo deadline was drawing close I prayed to God that I receive my
          salary early so I would not miss out in the wonderful opportunity.
          Luckily for me, when it entered I reached out to him in this inbox and
          asked him if the offer is still on the table, I was astonished when he
          replied my message I told me I should go ahead and pay my application
          fee then apply through the <a href="./assignment.html">Link</a> without hesitation.
        </p>
        <p class="third" id="third">
          I have applied to many opportunities I have hopped on this year both
          international and local but kept getting rejections but Altschool
          Africa kept me going, I am anchored to them to make life better so I
          can become a world class software engineer. I have cut off anything
          that can weigh me down in this 1 year journey so I can fully focus and
          make my life better, seeing that I cannot combine the class and work
          because I was living at the factory and it takes away most of my time,
          I told my co-worker that I needed to quit the job. On July, I informed
          my employee that I am going back to school that I need to quit the job
          so I did. It was a bold decision to make because been a Nigerian and
          quitting a job that puts food on your name at the time being is not
          easy but one of the joy I had in me when I was quitting was that I
          have already purchased a laptop for the learning so what I needed next
          is data, I had to reach out to a friend that I helped in his shop
          whenever I am not attending class or learning and he gives me some
          allowance which I always invest in data. So this has been a hectic
          journey within the space of a year and half.
        </p>
        <p class="fourth" id="fourth">
          Choosing this career has been a wonderful decision for my because if you want to last at what you do
          then you have to do what you love you doing.
          My wish amidst all the said and unsaid pain and struggle is to become a world-class
          software engineer that will be useful and have an impact at the technological sector in
          my country Nigeria and the world at large and I know AltSchoolAfrica can be a stepping 
          stone into achieving that greatness.
          I also love the community here at AltSchoolAfrica and I wish to be a part of this growing
          community of togetherness where everyone is being cherished and one's opinion matters.
